            <h3>Tips to Minimize Aerosols Production and Exposure in the Laboratory</h3>
            <h4>Issue May & June 2022</h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
              The "Tips to Minimize Aerosol Production & Exposure in the Laboratory" infographic provides valuable guidance for creating a safer laboratory environment. 
              These tips focus on reducing the generation and exposure to potentially harmful aerosols. Recommendations include the use of respiratory protection, 
              such as N95 masks when necessary, dispensing liquids close to the reservoir to minimize aerosol formation during pipetting, and vortexing samples in containers with secure lids. 
              Additionally, the infographic suggests avoiding the formation of air bubbles when using syringes and using safety buckets with sealed caps and O-rings while centrifuging biological substances to prevent aerosol release. 
              Installing HEPA or hydrophobic filters in aspiration setups and removing syringe needles from animals carefully are also highlighted to minimize aerosols. 
              Lastly, conducting experiments with infectious materials inside biological safety cabinets (BSCs) is strongly advised. 
              These practices collectively help mitigate aerosol-related risks in laboratory settings, ensuring a safer and more controlled work environment.

            <h3>Bleach Safety Tips</h3>
            <h4>Issue March & April 2022</h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
              The "Bleach Safety Tips" infographic provides essential guidelines for safe and responsible handling of bleach in laboratory and workplace settings. 
              It emphasizes several key practices to ensure safety. 
              These include the proper storage of bleach in tightly sealed containers, away from incompatible and flammable materials, as well as preparing fresh bleach solutions regularly due to its instability at dilute concentrations.
              The infographic highlights the importance of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as safety eyewear, nitrile gloves, lab coats, long pants, and closed-toe shoes when working with bleach. 
              Additional PPE like face shields and impervious aprons are required when handling larger volumes.
              Moreover, the guidance stresses the purchase and use of the lowest necessary volume and concentration of bleach. 
              It advises wiping down bleach-treated surfaces with water to remove disinfectant residue. 
              Importantly, it cautions against mixing bleach with DNA/RNA extraction kit wastes or incompatible chemicals, as such combinations can produce hazardous gases and reactions.
              The infographic also warns against pouring excessive amounts of undiluted bleach down drains, as it can lead to pressure build-up in piping systems and corrode metal wastewater pipes. 
              Lastly, it emphasizes that bleach should not be used on electronic equipment, optical equipment, or unpainted stainless steel due to its corrosive nature.
              These comprehensive safety tips promote the responsible use of bleach and reduce the risk of accidents, exposure to hazardous chemicals, 
              and damage to equipment and infrastructure.

            <h3>Chemical Safety Training</h3>
            <h4>Issue January & February 2022</h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
              The "Chemical Safety Training" infographic underscores the critical importance of proper chemical management and training to mitigate potential hazards in laboratory environments. 
              It emphasizes the consequences of inadequate chemical handling, which can include fires, explosions, chemical burns, and health risks. 
              To address these concerns, NUS requires all staff and students to complete OSHE chemical safety training and mandates an induction program for new laboratory users. 
              The goal is to ensure that everyone involved in laboratory activities is well-prepared to handle chemicals safely.
              The infographic provides a list of key areas of knowledge that individuals should be familiar with before working with chemicals in the laboratory. 
              These include emergency response procedures for scenarios like chemical spills, gas leaks, and fires. 
              Understanding the NUS Laboratory Chemical Safety Manual, experimental procedures, hazards, precautionary measures, 
              research activities, and equipment SOPs are also essential. Knowledge of Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for chemicals, safe disposal of chemical waste, 
              and safe practices for transporting, transferring, using, and storing chemicals further contribute to a comprehensive chemical safety framework. 
              In summary, the infographic serves as a reminder to prioritize safety and health when handling chemicals and to ensure that all necessary precautions and knowledge are in place for safe laboratory operations.

            <h3>Tips on Safe Handling of Laboratory Chemicals</h3>
            <h4>Issue September & October 2021</h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
              The "TIPs on Safe Handling of Laboratory Chemicals" infographic offers a set of essential guidelines for the safe and responsible handling of laboratory chemicals. 
              These tips emphasize the importance of safe chemical storage and waste management. 
              They recommend the use of plastic containers for corrosive waste collection to prevent leaks and the need for spill response. 
              Advising against overstocking chemicals, the infographic suggests evaluating current supplies and ordering the minimum required to prevent large-scale lab clean-outs.
              Secondary containment is highlighted as a crucial measure to ensure the safe containment of spills, leaks, and container over-pressurizations. 
              Researchers are encouraged to give or share chemicals that are expired or no longer needed, reducing hazardous waste generation. 
              Leaving headspace in waste containers to accommodate expansion during storage and transport is recommended to minimize spill potential. 
              Finally, the infographic underscores the importance of proper chemical labeling to prevent the disposal of "unknown" substances, 
              which can lead to higher disposal costs and analytical testing requirements. 
              These tips collectively promote a safer and more efficient laboratory environment while minimizing the risks associated with chemical handling and disposal.
