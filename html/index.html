            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px;">
              The infographic titled "Good Practices for Shaker Incubator Usage" offers a set of essential guidelines to ensure safe and effective operation of shaker incubators in laboratory settings. 
              It emphasizes the importance of using smaller volumes of culture broth in the flasks, avoiding overfilling to one-fifth of the total capacity. 
              Secure attachment of test tube racks to the stainless steel platform using screws is recommended, while labeling cultures with essential information like name, date, and organism helps with accurate identification and safe handling. 
              Proper clamping and use of the correct clamp size prevent spills during shaking procedures, and setting safe speeds is vital to avoid culture spillage. 
              Proper waste disposal and not leaving cultures unattended are essential for responsible laboratory practices. 
              Lastly, training and familiarity with emergency procedures among shaker incubator users are emphasized to ensure safety in cases of power failures, spillages, or unforeseen events. 
              Adhering to these practices contributes to a secure and efficient laboratory environment while minimizing risks and errors.

            <h3>Good Practices for Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) Usage</h3>
            <h4>Issue July & August 2023</h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px;">
              The "Good Practices for Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) Usage" infographic outlines key guidelines for safe and effective BSC operation. 
              It stresses the importance of thorough sterilization before and after use to prevent cross-contamination. 
              It advises against storing items on top of the BSC, as this can disrupt airflow and compromise efficiency. 
              Regular maintenance and certification by qualified personnel are recommended to ensure proper functioning. 
              Maintaining the sash window at the manufacturer's designated height is crucial, with alarms in place to alert users if it's not aligned correctly. 
              Clutter in the workspace should be minimized to preserve containment efficiency, and proper training and emergency procedures are essential to ensure user safety and preparedness for unexpected events. 
              Adhering to these practices is vital for maintaining a secure and efficient laboratory environment.

            <h3>Laboratory Safety Culture</h3>
            <h4>Issue May & June 2023</h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px;">
              The "Laboratory Safety Culture" infographic underscores the importance of fostering a safety-focused mindset and behavior within laboratory settings. 
              A strong laboratory safety culture is characterized by shared beliefs, values, attitudes, and practices aimed at prioritizing safety in all aspects of laboratory operations. 
              It promotes proactive hazard identification and mitigation, the allocation of time and resources to improve safety, and a commitment to continuous improvement.
              Achieving a robust safety culture requires the collective effort of all members within the organization, 
              including administrators, educators, principal investigators, researchers, laboratory personnel, and students. 
              In particular, for departments engaged in research on infectious microbes, instilling a strong safety culture is of paramount importance. 
              The infographic hints at the strategies that may be elaborated further in the full document, which could include methods for hazard assessment, 
              risk mitigation, training programs, and the establishment of safety protocols to maintain a safe and healthy laboratory environment. 
              By embracing a positive laboratory safety culture, organizations can significantly reduce the risks associated with laboratory work, 
              ensuring the well-being of everyone involved and enhancing overall research quality.
