            <h3>Autoclave Safety</h3>
            <h4>Issue January & February 2023</h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px;">
              The "Autoclave Safety" infographic provides crucial guidelines for safe and responsible autoclave usage in laboratory settings. 
              It addresses two primary hazards: explosion and burn. To mitigate explosion risks, it recommends loosening container covers, limiting liquid levels in bottles to 2/3, ensuring adequate space for steam circulation, and avoiding abrupt agitation when unloading items. 
              For burn prevention, it advises wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), waiting for zero pressure and temperatures at or below 80°C before opening the autoclave door, and doing so slowly to release steam safely. 
              It also emphasizes never autoclaving sharps waste or hazardous and reactive chemicals, as the high temperature and pressure can lead to dangerous reactions and toxic byproducts. 
              Similarly, bleach and bleach-treated items should not be autoclaved to prevent the release of hazardous chlorine gas. 
              These guidelines promote a secure laboratory environment and reduce the risk of accidents and chemical exposures during autoclave operations.
