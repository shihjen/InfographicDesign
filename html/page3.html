            <h3>Sonication Safety Tips</h3>
            <h4>Issue November & December 2022</h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
              The "Sonication Safety Tips" infographic provides essential guidelines for safe sonication procedures in the laboratory. 
              It addresses two primary hazards associated with sonication. 
              Firstly, it highlights the risk of hearing damage due to the high-frequency sound produced during the process. 
              Users are advised to operate the sonicator in a designated sonicator room with the door closed to minimize exposure to noise. 
              Additionally, they should use appropriate hearing protection, such as earmuffs or earplugs, and avoid operating the sonicator in the presence of individuals not wearing hearing protection. 
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 50px;">  
              The second hazard discussed is the generation of aerosols during sonication, particularly relevant when working with infectious or potentially infectious materials. 
              To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to conduct experiments involving such materials inside biological safety cabinets (BSCs). 
              After sonication, users should allow aerosols to settle for at least 5 minutes before opening the sonicator jar. 
              Furthermore, proper hygiene is emphasized, including the cleaning of the sonicator probe with 70% ethanol after each experiment. 
              These safety measures contribute to a safer laboratory environment by reducing the risk of hearing damage and potential exposure to hazardous aerosols.

            <h3>Prohibited Materials in Cold Room</h3>
            <h4>Issue September & October 2022</h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
              The "Prohibited Materials in Cold Room" infographic provides essential information to ensure the safety and integrity of laboratory cold room environments. 
              The cold room serves as a critical space for microbial culture, biological material storage, and temperature-sensitive experiments, 
              often utilizing recirculation for temperature and humidity control. 
              However, due to limited ventilation in cold rooms, the release of hazardous materials can pose health and safety risks to occupants. 
              Therefore, certain materials and activities must be avoided within this environment.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 50px;">
              Compressed gases like liquid nitrogen should be handled cautiously since they can displace oxygen, potentially leading to oxygen-deficient conditions. 
              Hazardous chemicals should not be used due to the lack of exhaust ventilation, which could expose lab personnel to a hazardous atmosphere in case of spillage. 
              Dry ice is problematic because it releases carbon dioxide gas during sublimation, creating an oxygen-deficient environment. 
              Similarly, volatile flammable solvents can accumulate, potentially creating an explosive atmosphere that could be ignited by various sources within the cold room. 
              Open flame activities, such as using a Bunsen burner, should be avoided to mitigate fire hazards. 
              Lastly, food and drinks must not be stored in cold rooms as they can become contaminated by biological organisms or chemicals. 
              Adhering to these guidelines is crucial for maintaining a safe and effective cold room environment in the laboratory.

            <h3>Emergency Response for Electrical Shock</h3>
            <h4>Issue July & August 2022</h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
              The "Emergency Response for Electrical Shock" infographic offers a clear and concise guide for handling electrical shock incidents. 
              When someone suffers a severe electrical shock, the initial steps are crucial for their safety. 
              If the person is unconscious but still in contact with the electrical current, it is essential to turn off the power source immediately. 
              If this is not possible, using a non-conductive object like a wooden pole to separate the victim from the power source is recommended. 
              Contacting the Office of Campus Security is a priority to ensure that professional assistance is on the way.
              Importantly, one should not leave the victim unattended unless absolutely necessary. 
              Staying with the victim until emergency services (SCDF) arrive is crucial. 
              After ensuring the victim is no longer in contact with the electrical current, check if they are conscious. 
              If conscious, advise the victim not to move and provide necessary first aid if there are visible injuries. 
              If the victim is unconscious, check for signs of breathing. 
              If there is no breathing, individuals trained in CPR should initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and assess for a pulse. 
              These steps help ensure a coordinated and potentially life-saving response to electrical shock incidents.
